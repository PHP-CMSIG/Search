# Schranz Search

Monorepository for the search abstraction over different search engine.

### SEAL

What `doctrine/dbal` is for `doctrine`, the `schranz-search/SEAL` is for `schranz-search` package.
It provides a common interface to interact with different search engines.

Read more about it in the [README.md](packages/seal/README.md) of the package.

### Elasticsearch
 
Widely used search based on Java.

 - Server: [Elasticsearch Server](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch)
 - PHP Client: [Elasticsearch PHP](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-php)

### Opensearch
 
Fork of Elasticsearch also written in Java.

 - Server: [Opensearch Server](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch)
 - PHP Client: [Opensearch PHP](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-php)

### RediSearch
 
A search out of the house of the redis labs.

 - Server: [RediSearch Server]([https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch))
 - PHP Client: [RediSearch PHP](https://github.com/MacFJA/php-redisearch)

### Zinc Labs

Zinc search describes itself as a lightweight alternative to Elasticsearch written in GoLang.

 - Server: [Zinclabs Server](https://github.com/zinclabs/zinc)
 - PHP Client: No PHP SDK currently: [https://github.com/zinclabs/zinc/issues/12](https://github.com/zinclabs/zinc/issues/12)

### Solr

A search engine under the Apache Project based on Lucene written in Java:

 - Server: [Solr Server](https://github.com/apache/solr)
