## üëã Introduction

The **SEAL** project is a PHP library designed to simplify the process of interacting
with different search engines. It provides a straightforward interface that enables users
to communicate with various search engines, including:

- [Elasticsearch](packages/seal-elasticsearch-adapter)
- [Opensearch](packages/seal-opensearch-adapter)
- [Meilisearch](packages/seal-meilisearch-adapter)
- [Algolia](packages/seal-algolia-adapter)
- [Loupe](packages/seal-loupe-adapter)
- [Solr](packages/seal-solr-adapter)
- [RediSearch](packages/seal-redisearch-adapter)
- [Typesense](packages/seal-typesense-adapter)
- [Memory](packages/seal-memory-adapter)
- ... missing something? Let us know!

It also provides integration packages for the

[Symfony](integrations/symfony),
[Laravel](integrations/laravel),
[Spiral](integrations/spiral),
[Mezzio](integrations/mezzio) 
and [Yii](integrations/yii) PHP frameworks.

It is worth noting that the project draws inspiration from the
``Doctrine`` and ``Flysystem`` projects. These two projects have been a great inspiration
in the development of SEAL, as they provide excellent examples of how to create consistent
and user-friendly APIs for complex systems.

> **Note**:
> This project is heavily under development and any feedback is greatly appreciated.

## üèóÔ∏è Structure

![SEAL Structure overview](docs/_images/overview.svg)


SEAL's provides a basic abstraction layer for add, remove and search and filters for documents.
The main class and service handling this is called `Engine`, which is responsible for all this things.
The `Schema` which is required defines the different `Indexes` and their `Fields`.

The project provides different `Adapters` which the Engine uses to communicate with the different `Search Engine` software and services.
This way it is easy to switch between different search engine software and services.

| `Engine`        | The main class and service responsible to provide the basic interface for add, remove and search and filters for documents.                                                                       |
| `Schema`        | Defines the different `Indexes` and their `Fields`, for every field a specific type need to be defined and what you want todo with them via flags like `searchable`, `filterable` and `sortable`. |
| `Adapter`       | Provides the communication between the Engine and the Search Engine software and services.                                                                                                        |
| `Documents`     | A structure of data that you want to index need to follow the structure of the fields of the index schema.                                                                                        |
| `Search Engine` | Search Engine software or service where the data will actually be stored currently `Meilisearch`, `Opensearch`, `Elasticsearch`, `Algolia`, `Redisearch`, `Solr` and `Typesense` is supported.    |
